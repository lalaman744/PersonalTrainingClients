# PersonalTrainingClients

This app is to help personal trainers help keep track of clients and client information for each session.  
The goal is to add a camera function so that a picture can be taken at the end of each session so clients and trainer
can accurately keep track of progress.


Uses CoreData to store client information as well as session information.  

Items left to do:
1. Add camera function and correlating view controller
2. Create an additiona Entity with relation to Client Name data so that session data can be accurately stored.
3. Add additional text boxes for more information such as current weight, date, and various notes about the session such as workouts completed.
